# Cell-Segmentation-with-Multi-head-UNet

The aim of this project is to segment and classify individual cells from microscopy images, a crucial task in biomedical image analysis. Precise cell segmentation plays a key role in automated disease diagnosis, drug testing, and cellular behavior modeling. In this work, we leverage powerful deep learning architectures like **UNet with EfficientNetV2** as backbone and combine them with **self-supervised learning techniques** to produce a robust and generalizable model for cell segmentation.

We are making this an open-source repository, enabling others to contribute improvements‚Äîbe it via new datasets, better loss functions, or optimized training pipelines!

## üß¨ About the Data

The dataset used is **LIVECell**, a challenging and diverse dataset containing various cell lines captured under different conditions. Due to inter-cell variability, class imbalance, and domain noise, training an accurate model requires thoughtful architecture design and domain-specific preprocessing.

We used **clinical-style augmentations** inspired by microscopy environments such as brightness shifts, blur, and spatial distortions to improve generalization on unseen samples.

## üß† Model Architecture

- **Encoder**: Pretrained **EfficientNetV2** backbone, trained using **self-supervised contrastive learning** and **image inpainting** tasks to capture robust feature representations.
- **Decoder**: A multi-head UNet decoder structure that predicts both segmentation masks and auxiliary classification labels.
- **Loss Functions**: Used domain-specific composite losses including Dice loss and BCE to handle class imbalance.
- **Input Pipeline**: Augmented features were generated using a combination of geometric and photometric augmentations to simulate real-world variations in microscope captures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Training

- Fine-tuned on the LIVECell dataset for 50+ epochs using PyTorch.
- Trained using Google Colab with a mixed precision training setup for efficient computation.
- Leveraged transfer learning to accelerate convergence and improve performance on limited labeled samples.

## üìä Results

The model achieved the following results on the validation split of the LIVECell dataset:

- **F1 Score**: 0.85
- **Precision**: ~0.83
- **Recall**: ~0.87
- **Dice Coefficient**: 0.84

These results show strong performance on unseen data and robustness across cell types.
